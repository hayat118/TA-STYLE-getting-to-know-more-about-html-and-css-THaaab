         <h2 class="C">CAT</h2>
          <P class="B">The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
             It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred
              to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
              A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely 
              and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship 
              and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various 
              cat registries.</P>

          <h2 class="C">DOG</h2>
          <P class="B">The dog or domestic dog  is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is characterized 
            by an upturning tail. The dog is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,
            and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.
             The dog was the first species to be domesticated,[9][8] by hunterâ€“gatherers over 
             15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.</P>
