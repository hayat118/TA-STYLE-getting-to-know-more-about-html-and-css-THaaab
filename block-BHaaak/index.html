    <h2>Mountain</h2>
      <p>mountain, landform that rises prominently above its surroundings, generally exhibiting steep slopes,
       a relatively confined summit area, and considerable local relief. Mountains generally are understood 
       to be larger than hills, but the term has no standardized geological meaning.</p>
    <h2>Northern plains</h2>
      <p>The northern plain has been formed by the interplay of the three major river systems,
       namely the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra along with their tributaries.
        This plain spreads over an area of 7 lakh sq. km. The plain being about 2400 Km long and 240 to 320 Km broad,
         is a densely populated physiographic division. With a rich soil cover combined with adequate water supply
          and favourable climate it is agriculturally a very productive part of India.</p>
      <h2>Penisular india</h2>
      <p>The Peninsular India comprises the diverse topological and climatic patterns of South India. 
        The Peninsula is in shape of a vast inverted triangle, bounded on the west by the Arabian Sea,
         on the east by the Bay of Bengal and on the north by the Vindhya and Satpura ranges.</p>
