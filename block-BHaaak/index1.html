    <h2>Indus River System</h2>
     <p>The Indus receives its most-notable tributaries from the eastern Punjab Plain.
        These five rivers—the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej—give the 
        name Punjab (“Five Rivers”) to the region divided between Pakistan and India.</p>
    <h2>Ganga River System</h2>
     <p> Ganga river system known as the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) River Basin, it is one of the largest 
       river systems in the world. The melting water from the Himalayas, as well as water
        from tributaries and rainfall, all feed the sacred river. The Ganges flows
         south and east from the Himalayas, forming a canyon as it leaves the mountain.</p>
